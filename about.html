                    <p class="bio">Traveler in search of meaning in the midst of his own, the humans. He seeks what he calls these "strange strangers". He likes to travel alone, without plans, trusting only his intuition and his meetings. In 2017, he landed in Beirut, which transformed him. Throughout his stay, he found the emulation, the chaos and the community he needed to produce and express himself freely, on the city walls through street art as well as through photography.
                        Integrated into the graffiti scene, he photographs artists from 5 continents during jam sessions, festivals or in the streets of the cities where he passes by.
                        He seeks to photograph for the press in order to understand and make understand what motivates humanity to act or react.
                        The essence of his artistic work is duality and the questioning of reality. He considers himself to be emotionally binary, without nuances. For him the expression through art is a necessity: it is not a hobby but an outlet. His techniques range from collage to photography and mixed media.</p>
