                    <h1 class="serie-title">Revolution blues</h1>
                    <p class="serie-text">Revolution Blues is a serie of portraits about the change of mindset of Lebanese citizens, between 20 and 40 years old in Ashrafieh, Beirut, following 4 months of uprising. It is the story of an awareness. Of those people who before the revolution dreamed of a radical change and who today do not really know what this popular uprising is leading to. From now on, faced with the immobility of the situation, they have to think differently and further.
                        Since 17 October 2019, Lebanon has been experiencing a popular uprising born of a loss of confidence in the ruling class. The mismanagement of the mid-October fires that ravaged 1,200 hectares of country's forest heritage, as well as the attempt to introduce a tax on free online Whatsapp messaging, were the triggers of a revolt that had been brewing for several months, if not years.
                        For more than four months now, this country, already in a bad economic situation, has been in slow motion. The Lebanese are experiencing the worst economic crisis since the civil war (1975-1990).</p>
